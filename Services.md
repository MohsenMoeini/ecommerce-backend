## Service Layer Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service focuses on a specific domain area
- **Interface-based Design**: Services implement interfaces for better testability and loose coupling
- **Transactional Boundaries**: Business operations are properly transactional
- **Security Integration**: Authorization checks embedded in service operations
- **Layered Architecture**: Services coordinate between controllers and repositories

## Service Interactions

Services collaborate to deliver complex business operations:

- **Checkout Process**: Coordinates Cart, Order, Inventory, and Notification services
- **Product Search**: Integrates Product, Category, and Inventory data
- **Order Fulfillment**: Coordinates Order, Inventory, and Notification services
- **Analytics**: Aggregates data from multiple service domains

The service layer is designed to be extensible, allowing for new functionality to be added with minimal changes to existing code.
